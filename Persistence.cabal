name:           Persistence
version:        2.0.3
category:       Data, Math
synopsis:       A versatile library for topological data analysis.
description:    A topological data analysis library motivated by flexibility when it comes to the type of data being analyzed. If your data comes with a meaningful binary function into an ordered set, you can use Persistence to analyze your data. The library also provides functions for analyzing directed\/undirected, weighted\/unweighted graphs. See the README for resources on learning about topological data anlysis.
